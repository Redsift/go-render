# Docker + iTerm

The excellent iTerm2 supports [displaying images](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-images.html) in the terminal using a set of proprietary escape sequences.

Based on the standard [imgcat](https://raw.github.com/gnachman/iTerm2/master/tests/imgcat) script, `htmlcat` uses the same sequence to perform a headless render of a HTML file or remote web page in your terminal window.

Works best with Docker for Mac - Beta
